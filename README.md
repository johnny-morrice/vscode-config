# My Visual Studio Code config

I migrated from Atom, so I use some atom keybindings.

I use Eclipse at work which doesn't let me change all the keybindings I want
to. So these keybindings also match some of what Eclipse does.

This is important to me, because if I don't have the right shortcuts memorised
I use the wrong shortcuts when I'm at work, which is frustrating.
